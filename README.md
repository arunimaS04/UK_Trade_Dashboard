The goal of this project is to use Power BI to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for analysing the dynamics of import and export and trade balances in the UK. The dashboard uses information from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to give insightful information about trade performance, trends, and important trading partners.
The analysis covers the period from 2014 to 2024.
The primary data sources for this project are the trade statistics provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS):
1)UK Trade in Goods by Country
2)UK Trade in Services by Country
3)Monthly UK Trade Overview
